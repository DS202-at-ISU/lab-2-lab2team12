# Lab report \#1

Follow the instructions posted at
<https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html> for the lab assignment. The
work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for
grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on
Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that
you are done with your submission.

Here are details for few of the columns.

1.  Parcel ID

Type: Character (or categorical) Description: A unique identifier for
each property. Expected Range: 10 digit numbers.

Address

Type: Character (or categorical) Description: The physical address of
the property. Expected Range: any address in Ames.

Style

Type: Character (or categorical) Description: The architectural style of
the property (e.g., ranch, colonial). Expected Range: Various story
frames.

2.  The variable of interest here is Sale Price.

3.  

``` r
summary(ames$`Sale Price`)
```

    ##     Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max. 
    ##        0        0   170900  1017479   280000 20500000

Range for sale price is 20500000-0 (max-min) = 20500000

``` r
library(ggplot2)
```

``` r
ggplot(ames, aes(x = `Sale Price`)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

Shape: The distribution seems to be right skewed. Peaks: There seems to
be multiple peaks in the data. Common Values: The histogram shows that
low sale prices are most commonly represented. Oddities: The histogram
indicates that there are very few properties sold at high price points,
specifically at \$15,000,000 and \$20,000,000, as evidenced by the small
bars at these intervals.‚Äù

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- --> Shape: It
seems to be uniformally distributed but skewed a little to the right.
Common Values: The most frequent number of bedrooms are from 3 to 4.
Outliers: Few houses have more than 7 bedrooms.

SCATTERPLOT

Most of the homes are sold for below \$200000 regardless of the number
of bedrooms. There is no relation between number of bedrooms and sale
price for the outliers shown above.
